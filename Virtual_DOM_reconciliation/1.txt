The difference between Real Dom vs Virtual Dom::
Real DOM: The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. The real DOM represents the actual HTML structure of a web page. Manipulating the real DOM directly can be slow because any changes trigger reflows and repaints, which are expensive operations.
Virtual DOM: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM maintained by React. It's a JavaScript representation of the actual DOM elements.

Benefits:
Performance: Manipulating the Virtual DOM is faster than directly manipulating the real DOM because changes are batched and optimized.
Cross-platform consistency: The Virtual DOM helps maintain consistency across different platforms by abstracting away the underlying differences in browser implementations of the real DOM.
Developer productivity: Developers can work with a more familiar and expressive programming model (JSX) while letting React handle the efficient updating of the UI.

How Does the Virtual DOM Work?
> Initialization: When a React component is first rendered, React creates a virtual DOM tree that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM.
> Rendering: Whenever there's a change in the component's state or props, React re-renders the component and generates a new virtual DOM tree.
> Diffing: React compares the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one to identify the differences.
> Reconciliation: React updates the real DOM efficiently by applying only the necessary changes identified during the diffing process.
> Completion: After updating the real DOM, React completes the rendering cycle, and the UI is updated on the screen.


Difference between virtual dom and fibre in React

The Virtual DOM and React Fiber are related concepts in React, but they serve different purposes and address different aspects of the rendering process.

Virtual DOM:

Purpose:
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM structure.
It acts as an intermediary between the React components and the real DOM, allowing React to efficiently update the UI by minimizing direct manipulations of the real DOM.

Reconciliation:
The Virtual DOM facilitates the process of reconciliation, where React compares the current Virtual DOM with a previous version to identify the differences (or "diffs").
React then applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM, resulting in better performance by minimizing unnecessary DOM manipulations.

Performance Optimization:
By leveraging the Virtual DOM, React optimizes performance by batching and optimizing updates to the real DOM.
Updates to the Virtual DOM are typically faster than directly manipulating the real DOM, leading to smoother user experiences.

React Fiber:
Purpose:
React Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm, introduced in React version 16.0.
It aims to improve the rendering performance and enable new features like asynchronous rendering and error boundaries.

Rendering Algorithm:
Fiber introduces a more efficient rendering algorithm that prioritizes and schedules updates based on their priority levels.
It allows React to perform work in smaller, incremental units, making the rendering process more predictable and responsive.

Asynchronous Rendering:
One of the key features of React Fiber is its support for asynchronous rendering, which enables React to interrupt rendering work to handle high-priority updates, such as user interactions or animations.
Asynchronous rendering improves the user experience by ensuring that critical interactions are not blocked by ongoing rendering tasks.

Concurrent Mode:
Fiber enables Concurrent Mode, a rendering mode where React can render and commit updates in a non-blocking manner.
Concurrent Mode allows React to prioritize and schedule rendering work based on its urgency and importance, leading to smoother user interfaces and better performance under heavy load.
In summary, while the Virtual DOM serves as an efficient representation of the actual DOM structure, facilitating reconciliation and performance optimization, React Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm, introducing features like asynchronous rendering and Concurrent Mode to improve rendering performance and responsiveness.
