In React, props (short for properties) are a fundamental concept. They are a way of passing data from parent to child components in a React application.

Here's how props work:

Passing Props: You pass props from a parent component to a child component when you include the child component in the JSX of the parent component. You can pass any data type as props, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, functions, etc.Example:
jsx
Copy code
// ParentComponent.js
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent name="John" age={30} />
    </div>
  );
}
Receiving Props: In the child component, you receive props as an argument to the functional component (or as a parameter in the class component constructor) and use them as needed.Example:
jsx
Copy code
// ChildComponent.js
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
Using Props: Once received, you can use props to dynamically render content, pass data, or trigger functionality within the child component.Example:
jsx
Copy code
// ChildComponent.js
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
      <button onClick={props.onClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
Immutable Props: Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the child component. They are read-only. If you need to modify data, you can do it in the parent component and pass the modified data down as props again.
Props play a crucial role in React's component-based architecture, facilitating the building of reusable and composable UI components.
