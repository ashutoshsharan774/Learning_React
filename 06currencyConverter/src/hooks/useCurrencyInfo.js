    console.log(data);

//since data return kr rhe iska matlab setdata ni kr pyenge lekin aisa ni ha isiliye ye ek custom hook ha 
//humne ky kara ek puri ki puri functionality design kri aur method ko hi return kr diya

/*Declaring Effects: You define effects inside function components using the useEffect hook. You pass a function as the first argument, which represents the effect you want to perform.

Triggering Effects: By default, the effect runs after every render, including the initial render. However, you can control when the effect runs by providing a second argumentâ€”an array of dependencies. If any of the dependencies change between renders, the effect will re-run. If you provide an empty dependency array, the effect runs only once after the initial render, similar to componentDidMount in class components.

Cleaning Up Effects: If your effect involves any cleanup (like unsubscribing from a subscription or clearing a timer), you can return a function from the effect. This function will be called when the component unmounts or before the effect runs again due to a dependency change.
