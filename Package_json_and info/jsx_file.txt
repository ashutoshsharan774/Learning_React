JSX (JavaScript XML):
React introduces JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
JSX enables the embedding of HTML structures directly within JavaScript code, making it easier to visualize and understand the component's structure.

Here are some key points about JSX:

HTML-like Syntax: JSX resembles HTML syntax, allowing you to write markup directly within JavaScript code. For example:
jsx
Copy code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
Embedding Expressions: JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces {}. This enables dynamic content and expressions to be included within JSX elements. For example:
jsx
Copy code
const name = 'John';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
Components as JSX Elements: React components can also be used as JSX elements. This allows you to compose complex UIs by nesting components within each other. For example:
jsx
Copy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <p>This is a React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
Attributes and Props: JSX supports HTML-like attributes and allows you to pass props to components. Props are passed as attributes to JSX elements and accessed within components using props object. For example:
jsx
Copy code
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
};

const element = <MyComponent name="John" />;
No Browser Dependency: JSX is not natively understood by web browsers. Instead, it is transpiled by tools like Babel into regular JavaScript code that browsers can interpret.
While JSX is not required to build React applications, it is a widely adopted and recommended approach due to its readability, expressiveness, and similarity to HTML. JSX makes it easier to visualize and understand the structure of React components, leading to more maintainable and efficient code.
